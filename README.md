# VulnAnalysis
In this project, we will simulate a vulnerability management scan on a simulated CMDB using the NIST NVD API. Both Vms sit on the same network with an unsecure http connection. Being a small-scale project, this and hosting a CMBD on a flask webserver is fine, but for real-world application, this is bad practice.
